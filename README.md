1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I rely on clear structure, modular functions, descriptive variable names, and consistent formatting. In Project One, the CRUD Python module was written using object-oriented programming principles, making each function specific and reusable. This approach allowed me to easily connect the database operations to the dashboard in Project Two with minimal modifications. One of the biggest advantages of working this way was the separation of logic—any changes in the database queries didn’t require touching the dashboard logic. This module could be reused in other projects involving MongoDB, such as animal tracking, inventory systems, or client-facing dashboards that require real-time data querying.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first understanding the user’s needs, translating those into technical requirements, and then building solutions iteratively. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I analyzed the client’s goals, examined the rescue use cases, and designed filters and interactive widgets based on the required dog breeds and rescue types. Compared to previous assignments, this project was more realistic and collaborative, requiring back-and-forth between data handling and user interface development. In future projects, I would use ER diagrams for planning, schema validation to ensure data consistency, and automated testing to catch issues early when building databases to meet other client requirements.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design, implement, and optimize systems that solve real-world problems using computation. Our role goes beyond just coding—we architect solutions that enable efficiency, scalability, and better decision-making. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, my work provides them with a powerful tool to analyze, filter, and visualize potential rescue dogs, saving them time and improving the accuracy of their selection process. This kind of technology enables the organization to focus more on their core mission—training dogs for life-saving operations—by automating data analysis and simplifying workflows.
